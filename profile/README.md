### What does the name mean?

Unreasonable Magic is a combination of 2 of my favorite things:

1. The book [Unreasonable Hospitality](https://www.unreasonablehospitality.com) by Will Guidara
2. The company that many engineers joined after Steve Jobs was fired from Apple https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Magic

These inspirations become our north star. We will put an *UNREASONABLE* amount of *MAGIC* into the software we build.
